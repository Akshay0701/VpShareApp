development in the educational area.

educational resources to different schools and NGOs that provides free education to 
children’s. This capstone project aims toward developing an efficient and user-friendly 
android application that will be able to provide NGOs and Schools, staffs that are useful 
for students with all the needed material being used during education. It is an android app 
that allows users to login and register themselves where they can simply donate the 
materials which they want to provide to the needy children effortlessly. Thereafter the 
login and registration process, a commander will be reporting to the registered user’s 
locality where the users will be provided a bag/pouch in which they are allowed donate the 
materials as they want.

### Importance of the Project: -
Our app provides an interface between the donor and the receiver. So, the
main of our project is that it allows users or the donors to donate the resources to
the people effortlessly. They can simply donate the materials in a bag which will be
provided by the commanders to them.
Thereafter the donation process, the donor will get complete information
with a confirmation where his donated material is being donated. It will also provide
secured authentication to the donor that resources are being delivered properly.


## Need of this application: -
The need of our application is that it serves as a medium to the donor to
donate resource through the app. One can donate the resources, easily from their
home. Whenever a donor donates, he will get complete information with a
confirmation where his donated materials is delivered or donated.
There is no fear of misplacement of the donated resources, as the
application provides a secured authentication to the donors. The donor can easily
donate the materials to the reporting commander without any fear. This application
provides the user a tracking ID to the donors to the donated materials.
