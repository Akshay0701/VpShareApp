----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V-Share System is a research project at Vidyalankar Polytechnic that leverages Android, Java, Google Map API, Firebase database, and Node.js technologies. The application serves a noble purpose, enabling users to donate educational resources to NGOs and schools in various rural areas of Mumbai. The system allows users to track the current location of their donated goods, providing them with notifications once the donation is received by the intended NGOs or schools. To keep users informed and engaged, the system sends notifications and email updates regarding the status of their donated goods as soon as they are received by the respective NGOs or schools. V-Share System is a significant step in empowering education by connecting donors and recipients seamlessly.
